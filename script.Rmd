## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(datasets)
library(dplyr)
data(iris)

calc_sepal_width_to_length_ratio <- function(data, value) {
        data <- data %>% mutate(sepal_width_to_length_ratio = (data[, 2]/data[, 1])*value)
        return(data)
}

df_100 <- calc_sepal_width_to_length_ratio(iris, 100)
df_100
df_10 <- calc_sepal_width_to_length_ratio(iris, 10)
df_10

```
